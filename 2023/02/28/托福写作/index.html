Accompanying this trend are more and more dilemmas and obstacles that challenge people on their ways to success. As a matter of fact, being successful is never an easy task, but involves the combined effects of tremendous efforts and self-reliance. Under no circumstances should people be forced give up their own fruits of diligence and intelligence when confronted with so-called responsibility of donating.</p>
<p>Nowadays, some universities are facing dormitory shortages. <strong>This is the result of</strong> an increase in the number of students going to colleges. <strong>Some claim</strong> that staying off campus is better than living on campus in the univercity. <strong>I disagree with this opinion because</strong> staying on campus brings students <strong>many benefits</strong>, it makes life more convenient, saves expenses, and provides students with an environment suitable for academic studies.</p>
<p>如今，一些大学正面临宿舍短缺的问题。 这是上大学的学生人数增加的结果。 有人声称住在校外比住在大学校园里要好。 我不同意这个意见，因为留在校园里给学生带来很多好处，它使生活更方便，节省开支，并为学生提供适合学术研究的环境。</p>
<p>Living on campus makes life more convenient for the students. <strong>That’s because</strong> living on campus allows students to get to the classroom and the library within walking distance. <strong>My brother, Jack, is an undergraduate</strong>. He lives 7 miles from the school with a boarding family. Everyday when he goes to class and comes home, he has to stand to wait for the bus to arrive. As a person of many interests, he takes a lot of courses and has to bring his notebooks from home to campus and then back to home everyday. <strong>“It is really tiring,” he once told me, “especially on rainy days, when I can’t put my bag down and have to stand there waiting for the bus with a heavy bag on my back.” If he had choosen to stay on the campus, he could have saved a lot of time and energy.</strong></p>
<p>住在校园里使学生的生活更加方便。 那是因为住在校园里可以让学生在步行距离内到达教室和图书馆。 我的兄弟杰克是一名本科生。 他和一个寄宿家庭住在离学校 7 英里的地方。 每天上课回家都要站着等公交车。 作为一个兴趣爱好广泛的人，他上了很多课，每天都要带着他的笔记本从家里到校园，然后再带回家。 “真的很累，”他曾对我说，“尤其是下雨天，我的包放不下，背着沉重的包站在那儿等车。” 如果当初选择留在校园里，他可以节省很多时间和精力。</p>
<p>What’s more, living on campus also cut expenses for students. The dormitory is cheaper than renting a house off campus and the food in the school cafeteria costs less than restaurants outside the university. Students aren’t completely economically independant. <strong>For those students who get loans for their education,</strong> being economical helps students by allowing them to get lower loan. A high loan during college may end up being a heavy burden after one joins the work force. <strong>For those who get economic support from their parents, it’ll also</strong> be nice to be considerate to their parents by saving some money. So it is obvious that living on campus costs less.</p>
<p>更重要的是，住在校园里也为学生节省了开支。 宿舍比校外租房便宜，学校食堂的饭菜比校外餐厅便宜。 学生在经济上并不完全独立。 对于那些获得教育贷款的学生来说，节俭可以帮助学生获得较低的贷款。 大学期间的高额贷款可能会成为一个人加入工作队伍后的沉重负担。 对于那些得到父母经济支持的人来说，存点钱体贴父母也是不错的。 所以很明显，住在校园里花费更少。</p>
<p>Last but not least, living on campus can provide students with an atmosphere more suitable for study. <strong>For those who stays off campus</strong>, they may have to face a noisy neighbor. <strong>And</strong> they may have incompatible time schedule with their roommate——they don’t have any other place to go to, <strong>and</strong> may have to finish their assignments while hearing their roommates having a party in the living room. <strong>However, if</strong> students live on campus, they can go to the lab from their dormitory very easily. And they also have access to the school library, which is a very quiet and comfortable place to do one’s studies. What’s more, all the other students in the library are also doing their work. This provides an atmosphere that no rented apartment can offer.</p>
<p>最后但同样重要的是，住在校园里可以为学生提供更适合学习的氛围。 对于那些住在校外的人来说，他们可能不得不面对吵闹的邻居。 而且他们可能与室友的时间安排不一致——他们没有其他地方可去，可能不得不一边完成作业一边听到室友在客厅开派对。 但是，如果学生住在校内，他们可以很方便地从宿舍到实验室。 他们还可以使用学校图书馆，这是一个非常安静和舒适的学习场所。 更何况图书馆里的其他同学也都在做作业。 这提供了任何出租公寓都无法提供的氛围。</p>
<p>In summary, considering the convenience it brings, the money it saves, and the atmosphere it creates, I agree with the statement that for university students, living on campus is better than off campus.</p>
<p>综上所述，考虑到它带来的便利、节省的金钱和营造的氛围，我同意大学生住在校内比校外更好的说法。</p>
<h1 id="品质交友"><a href="#品质交友" class="headerlink" title="品质交友"></a>品质交友</h1><p><strong>保持一小群长期稳定的朋友</strong>（旧，稳）</p>
<p>First and foremost, long-lasting friendships provide <strong>a sense of belonging</strong>, <strong>emotional support</strong>, and <strong>stability</strong> in one’s life. When we have a small group of <strong>friends who have been there for us through thick and thin</strong>, we feel more <strong>secure and grounded</strong>. We can <strong>rely on them to offer a listening ear, a shoulder to cry on, or a word of advice whenever we need it</strong>. This type of support is <strong>invaluable</strong> and can contribute greatly to our overall happiness and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>结交新朋友</strong>（新）</p>
<p>Firstly, making new friends can <strong>provide us with a fresh perspective and new experiences</strong>. Meeting new people can <strong>expose us to different cultures, lifestyles, and ideas that we may not have encountered before.</strong> This exposure can <strong>broaden our horizons, challenge our assumptions, and help us grow as individuals.</strong> In contrast, maintaining long-term friendships may not always provide the same level of exposure to new perspectives and experiences.</p>
<p>Making new friends can help us <strong>expand our social networks</strong> and <strong>build connections that may be useful in the future</strong>. These connections can offer us opportunities for <strong>career advancement</strong>, <strong>social support</strong>, and <strong>personal growth</strong>. <strong>Having a diverse network of friends and acquaintances can also help us navigate different social situations and environments with greater ease.</strong></p>
<h1 id="科技媒体"><a href="#科技媒体" class="headerlink" title="科技媒体"></a>科技媒体</h1><p><strong>科技坏：</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, technology overuse can lead to <strong>physical health problems</strong> such as <strong>eye strain, poor posture, and obesity.</strong> Young people who spend <strong>excessive amounts of time</strong> using technology may <strong>neglect physical exercise and other healthy behaviors</strong>, leading to <strong>long-term negative consequences</strong>.</p>
<p>Secondly, technology can contribute to <strong>social isolation</strong> and <strong>poor communication skills.</strong> Young people who spend too much time on their devices may <strong>have difficulty forming meaningful relationships</strong> and <strong>communicating effectively with others.</strong> This can lead to l<strong>oneliness, depression, and anxiety.</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, technology can <strong>expose</strong> young people <strong>to inappropriate content</strong> such as <strong>violent or sexual material</strong>. Young people <strong>may accidentally or intentionally access this content</strong>, leading to negative impacts on their <strong>mental health and development.</strong></p>
<p><strong>科技好：</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, technology can <strong>improve access to education and information,</strong> allowing young people to learn about <strong>a wide range of subjects and explore new ideas.</strong> This can lead to <strong>intellectual curiosity, critical thinking, and a lifelong love of learning.</strong></p>
<p>Secondly, technology can <strong>facilitate social connections and community building,</strong> allowing young people to <strong>connect with others who share their interests and values.</strong> This can lead to increased <strong>social support, a sense of belonging, and opportunities for collaboration and innovation.</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, technology can <strong>foster creativity and self-expression</strong>, allowing young people to <strong>explore their passions and interests in new and innovative way</strong>s. Technology tools such as s<strong>ocial media, video editing software, and digital art platforms</strong> can provide young people with <strong>new avenues for self-expression and creative exploration</strong></p>
<p><strong>In-Person 面对面交流的好处</strong>：</p>
<p>Firstly, when people communicate in person, they have the opportunity to <strong>read nonverbal cues</strong> such as <strong>facial expressions and body language.</strong> This can help them better understand each other’s perspectives, build trust, and resolve conflicts more effectively than they would through e-mail.</p>
<p>首先，当人们面对面交流时，他们有机会阅读非语言线索，例如面部表情和肢体语言。 与通过电子邮件相比，这可以帮助他们更好地了解彼此的观点、建立信任并更有效地解决冲突。</p>
<p>Secondly, <strong>face-to-face communication</strong> allows for <strong>more natural and dynamic conversations</strong>. People can <strong>build on each other’s ideas and brainstorm more creatively.</strong> They can also ask and answer questions <strong>in real-time, leading to a more efficient and effective exchange of information.</strong></p>
<p>其次，面对面的交流允许更自然和动态的对话。 人们可以借鉴彼此的想法，并更有创意地集思广益。 他们还可以实时提问和回答问题，从而提高信息交流的效率和效果</p>
<p><strong>网上交流的好处：</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, e-mail allows for <strong>asynchronous communication</strong>, meaning people can <strong>respond to messages on their own time</strong>. This can be especially helpful when people have <strong>busy schedules</strong> or <strong>work in different time zones.</strong></p>
<p>首先，电子邮件允许异步通信，这意味着人们可以在自己的时间回复消息。 当人们有繁忙的日程安排或在不同时区工作时，这尤其有用。</p>
<p>Secondly, e-mail provides <strong>a written record of communication,</strong> making it easier to <strong>refer back to previous conversations</strong> and <strong>keep track of important details.</strong> This can help <strong>avoid misunderstandings</strong> and ensure that everyone is on the same page.</p>
<p>其次，电子邮件提供了通信的书面记录，可以更轻松地回顾以前的对话并跟踪重要细节。 这有助于避免误解并确保每个人都在同一页面上。</p>
<p>Lastly, e-mail can be more <strong>inclusive</strong>, as it <strong>allows for participation from people who may not feel comfortable speaking up in a group setting.</strong> This can <strong>lead to a diversity of ideas and perspectives,</strong> <strong>leading to more creative and innovative solutions.</strong></p>
<p>最后，电子邮件可以更具包容性，因为它允许那些可能不习惯在群体环境中发言的人参与进来。 这可以导致想法和观点的多样性，从而产生更具创造性和创新性的解决方案。</p>
<h1 id="教育学习"><a href="#教育学习" class="headerlink" title="教育学习"></a>教育学习</h1><p><strong>年轻人需要independent：</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, independence is crucial for <strong>personal growth and development</strong>. By being independent, young people can learn how to <strong>take care of themselves</strong> and make decisions <strong>that align with their personal values and goals.</strong> When young people are given the freedom to make decisions about their own lives, they become <strong>more responsible and accountable for their actions</strong>, which is an essential life skill. This can lead to a greater sense of <strong>self-confidence and self-esteem</strong>, which are <strong>important for overall well-being.</strong></p>
<p>首先，独立对于个人的成长和发展至关重要。 通过独立，年轻人可以学习如何照顾自己并做出符合他们个人价值观和目标的决定。 这可以带来更大的自信和自尊感，这对整体幸福感很重要。</p>
<p>Secondly, having their own <strong>opinions and space</strong> allows young people to <strong>express themselves and explore their interests and passions</strong>. This can <strong>lead to a greater sense of purpose and direction in life</strong>, as well as a <strong>deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world.</strong></p>
<p>其次，有自己的见解和空间，可以让年轻人表达自己，发掘自己的兴趣爱好。 这可以带来更大的人生目标感和方向感，以及对自己和自己在世界上的位置的更深刻理解。</p>
<p><strong>年轻人需要听指导：</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, young people <strong>lack the life experience and maturity</strong> to make important decisions about their lives. Without guidance and support from parents, teachers, or other adults, they may make <strong>poor choices that could have negative consequences on their future</strong>. For example, a young person may decide to drop out of school to pursue a passion without understanding the long-term impact of that decision on their career prospects.</p>
<p>首先，年轻人缺乏生活经验和成熟度，无法对自己的人生做出重要决定。 如果没有父母、老师或其他成年人的指导和支持，他们可能会做出错误的选择，从而对他们的未来产生负面影响。 例如，一个年轻人可能决定辍学去追求自己的热情，却不了解该决定对其职业前景的长期影响。</p>
<p>Finally, young people are still developing their identities and values, and <strong>may not have a clear sense of what they want or need in life.</strong> Without the guidance and input of others, they may <strong>make decisions based on incomplete or inaccurate information, which could lead to regret or negative outcomes in the future.</strong></p>
<p>最后，年轻人仍在发展他们的身份认同和价值观，可能不清楚他们在生活中想要什么或需要什么。 如果没有他人的指导和输入，他们可能会根据不完整或不准确的信息做出决定，这可能会导致将来后悔或产生负面结果。</p>
<p><strong>年轻人压力太大了</strong>：</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Academic Pressure: Young people are often under significant pressure to excel academically, whether from parents, teachers, or society in general. They may feel the need to get good grades, secure a spot in a prestigious university, and ultimately achieve a successful career. This pressure can lead to stress, anxiety, and burnout, especially if they feel like they are falling behind their peers.</p>
<p>学业压力：年轻人通常承受着巨大的学业压力，无论是来自父母、老师还是整个社会。 他们可能觉得有必要取得好成绩，在名牌大学获得一席之地，并最终取得成功的职业生涯。 这种压力会导致压力、焦虑和倦怠，尤其是当他们觉得自己落后于同龄人时。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Social Pressure: Young people may also face pressure to fit in with their peers and social groups. They may feel the need to conform to certain social norms, such as dressing a certain way, listening to certain music, or engaging in specific activities. This pressure can lead to feelings of isolation or exclusion if they do not feel like they fit in with their peers.</p>
<p>社会压力：年轻人也可能面临融入同龄人和社会群体的压力。 他们可能觉得有必要遵守特定的社会o规范，例如以特定方式着装、听特定音乐或参加特定活动。 如果他们觉得自己不适合同龄人，这种压力可能会导致孤立或排斥感。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Personal Pressure: Young people may also face pressure to succeed in their personal pursuits, such as sports, hobbies, or other interests. They may feel like they need to excel in these areas in order to prove their worth or gain recognition from others. This pressure can lead to feelings of disappointment or self-doubt if they do not achieve the success they desire.</p>
<p>个人压力：年轻人也可能面临在个人追求方面取得成功的压力，例如运动、爱好或其他兴趣。 他们可能觉得自己需要在这些领域表现出色，才能证明自己的价值或获得他人的认可。 如果他们没有取得他们想要的成功，这种压力会导致失望或自我怀疑。</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>不应该浪费时间：</strong>(其实和压力大存在部分重合，但相对来说积极，年轻人压力大相当于抱怨)</p>
<p>Many young people today are driven by their passions and ambitions, which can lead to a desire to use their time efficiently and not waste any opportunities. With the fast-paced nature of society today, it can be easy to fall behind or miss out on important experiences if one does not use their time wisely. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Limited time: Young people <strong>have a limited amount of time to achieve their goals and dreams</strong>. Therefore, they need to be <strong>efficient and productive with their time</strong> in order to <strong>maximize their potential and achieve their desired outcomes.</strong></p>
<p>时间有限：年轻人实现目标和梦想的时间有限。 因此，他们需要在时间上保持高效和多产，以最大限度地发挥他们的潜力并实现他们想要的结果。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Competitive environment: <strong>Today’s world is highly competitive</strong>, and young people face intense pressure to succeed. Whether it’s in academics, sports, or their chosen career paths, young people are constantly competing against others to achieve their goals. This means that they c<strong>annot afford to waste time or miss opportunities to gain an edge over their competitors.</strong></p>
<p>竞争环境：当今世界竞争激烈，年轻人面临着巨大的成功压力。 无论是在学术、体育还是他们选择的职业道路上，年轻人都在不断地与他人竞争以实现自己的目标。 这意味着他们不能浪费时间或错过机会来获得优于竞争对手的优势。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rapidly changing world: <strong>The world is changing at an unprecedented rate</strong>, and young people need to <strong>adapt quickly to keep up with these changes.</strong> This requires them to <strong>be constantly learning and growing, which means they need to make efficient use of their time in order to stay ahead.</strong></p>
<p>瞬息万变的世界：世界正在以前所未有的速度变化，年轻人需要快速适应以跟上这些变化。 这要求他们不断学习和成长，这意味着他们需要有效利用时间才能保持领先。</p>
</li>
<li><p>Personal fulfillment: <strong>Pursuing one’s passions and goals can be incredibly fulfilling and rewarding</strong>. Young people have the <strong>opportunity to explore their interests and talents</strong>, and by making efficient use of their time, they can <strong>maximize their potential for personal growth and fulfillment.</strong></p>
<p>个人成就感：追求自己的激情和目标可以带来令人难以置信的成就感和回报。 年轻人有机会发掘自己的兴趣和才能，通过有效利用时间，他们可以最大限度地发挥个人成长和成就的潜力。</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I believe that it is better for all concerned if young adults continue to live with their families for a longer time, particularly if they are going to be studying at university or someting similar. </p>
<p>First of all, it is important to consider finances.</p>
<p>In addition to the importance of finances, I think this is better for a young adult’s study potential.</p>
<p>Finally, staying at home with one’s parents doesn’t necessarily mean that a young adult cannot develop independence.</p>
<p>By way of conclusion, based on the arguments explored above, I’m of the opinion that in most cases it’s actually more beneficial for most adults to continue living with their families for longer period of time.</p>

<p><u>Generally speaking, I believe that it is better for all concerned if young adults continue to live with their families for a longer time, particularly if they are going to be studying at university or someting similar.</u> </p>
<p><u>First of all, it is important to consider finances.</u>These days it costs a lot to rent a house , attend university,  buy a car or purchase things like insurance. By way of example, I can recall trying to live independently outside the family home as a university student and I constantly struggled to pay bills and meet all othe costs of living as a young adult.</p>
<p><u>In addition to the importance of finances, I think this is better for a young adult’s study potential.</u> With your families support, it is a lot easier to focus on your studises. You are more likely to eat better meals, have a quiet place to do school work and get a decent night’s sleep. I can recall a friend from my university days who lived in share house with other students. Life was a party for him but he didn’t eat or study well and inevitably his grades suffered. He had to repeat several subjects and finished his degree later than many of his peers.</p>
<p><u>Finally, staying at home with one’s parents doesn’t necessarily mean that a young adult cannot develop independence.</u> Even though I spent most of my university days living with my parents, they respected me as an adult as well as their child and they didn’t attempt to interfere too much or limit my independece. I think this is the case for many other young people as well, so i don’t think it is necessarily fair to claim that, just because someone is living with their family, they are somehow unable to enjoy benefits of indepence.</p>
<p><u>By way of conclusion, based on the arguments explored above, I’m of the opinion that in most cases it’s actually more beneficial for most adults to continue living with their families for longer period of time.</u></p>
<p>3.<strong>Stage3: concession&#x2F;conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Becoming an adult is a really special time in anybody’s life and the call to head out into the world and embrace our independence is, for many people, quite powerful.<strong>I think this can depend on a lot of different factors; for example, somebody</strong> starting a job might have different needs and priorities compared to a person who intends to go on and study at university.  <strong><u>Generally speaking, I believe that it is better for all concerned if young adults continue to live with their families for a longer time, particularly if they are going to be studying at university or someting similar.</u></strong> </p>
<p><u><strong>First of all,</strong> it is important to consider finances.</u><strong>Certainly, it is possible for some young adults</strong> to get work and support themselves relatively quickly.<strong>However, in most parts of the world</strong> <u>these days it costs a lot to rent a house , attend university,  buy a car or purchase things like insurance. <strong>By way of example, I can recall</strong> trying to live independently outside the family home as a university student and I constantly struggled to pay bills and meet all othe costs of living as a young adult.</u> <strong>This in turn have adverse effects  for things like my study performance.</strong>(This is called link)</p>
<p><strong>Hence, <u>In addition</strong> to the importance of finances, I think this is better for a young adult’s study potential.</u> <u>With your families support, it is a lot easier to focus on your studises.</u> <strong>Of course, for some people in some situations,</strong> the family situation may actually be quite distracting for stressful. <strong>However, I think it would be fair to say that (for most people)</strong> y<u>ou are more likely to eat better meals, have a quiet place to do school work and get a decent night’s sleep. <strong>I can recall a friend</strong> from my university days who lived in share house with other students. Life was a party for him but he didn’t eat or study well and inevitably his grades suffered. He had to repeat several subjects and finished his degree later than many of his peers.</u></p>
<p><u><strong>Finally</strong>, staying at home with one’s parents doesn’t necessarily mean that a young adult cannot develop independence.</u> <strong>I’ll be the first to admit that</strong> there are parents out there who struggle to acknowledge that their children have grown up and deserve treatment as adults**; it’s instinctive in many of them** to continue to play a ‘mothering’ role that can actually be quite stifling for a young adlult.<strong>Despite this possibility,</strong>  <u>even though I spent most of my university days living with my parents, they respected me as an adult as well as their child and they didn’t attempt to interfere too much or limit my independece. I think this is the case for many other young people as well, so i don’t think it is necessarily fair to claim that, just because someone is living with their family, they are somehow unable to enjoy benefits of indepence.</u>In fact, I believe the safe environment of the family is a good place to handle the transition to adulthood for all concerned, both the child and the parents.</p>
<p><u><strong>By way of conclusion, based on the arguments explored above, I’m of the opinion that in most cases</strong> it’s actually more beneficial for most adults to continue living with their families for longer period of time.</u>Families are precious things and an essential part of the fabric of a nurturing society, so have a strong belief that they can be a powerful guide in helping children negotiate the path to independence.</p>

<h4 id="Template："><a href="#Template：" class="headerlink" title="Template："></a><strong>Template：</strong></h4><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>The article and the lecture both deal with</strong> the voting system in the US. <strong>While the author of the reading thinks that</strong> the traditional voting system should be substituted for a computerized voting systerm <strong>for three specific reasons</strong>, <strong>the lecturer opposes the author’s claims. In his opinion,</strong> a computerized voting System is not a solution to current problems.</p>
<p><strong>First, te writer claims that</strong> when votes are cast on paper mistakes often occur due to people choosing the wrong candidate by accident. <strong>Furthermore, it is stated in the article that</strong> computerized voting machines are easier to use and the voter can even increase the size of the candidates’ names which facilitates reading them. which facilitates reading them. <strong>In contrast, the lecturer argues that</strong> voters who are not familiar with computers will have difficulties handling these machines. <strong>Additionally,he maintains that</strong> it is likely that these people enter the wrong vote or they may be deterred from voting at all because they are scared of electronic voting machines.</p>
<p><strong>Second, the author mentions that</strong> since in traditional voting the votes are counted by humans, mistakes are nearly unavoidable which can result in a lengthy and costly process of votes having to be recounted. <strong>On top of that, he adds that</strong> computerized voting Systems are not subject to human error because they count the votes automatically. <strong>However, the lecturer calls this argument into question by saying that</strong> computers are made by humans, and thus they are prone to errors. <strong>Further, he remarks that</strong> if an error is caused by an electronic voting machine, the situation is much worse as a huge number of votes may be counted incorrectly or deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, the writer asserts that</strong> the argument that using electronic voting systems is fraught with risk does not hold water. In fact, people put faith in computers on a daily basis, for example, when doing bank transfers or when communicating critical information. <strong>As opposed to the author, the lecturer holds that</strong> this technology had to be improved continuously which was only possible because it was used frequently. <strong>He highlights that</strong> voting is a rare event that takes place only every two years on a national level and not more than twice on a local level, which does not suffice to place full trust in computerized voting systems.</p>
